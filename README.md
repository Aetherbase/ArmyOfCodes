# ArmyOfCodes
This repo is in initial stage of development.
My idea is to port base arch binaries and libraries which would let us run Arch arm binaries in our phone with frontend of common development and hacking tools.
This idea can be said to be a fork of Mufeek's Linux Deploy, But specialized for Arch Linux
So my Fellow Arch fans, Stay tuned!! All suggestions accepted
